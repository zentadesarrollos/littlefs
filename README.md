![LittleFS](https://img.shields.io/badge/littlefs-embedded%20filesystem%20microcontroller-blue)

Welcome to **LittleFS**, a lightweight fail-safe filesystem designed specifically for microcontrollers. This project aims to provide a reliable and efficient way to manage file storage in resource-constrained environments. Whether you're working on an IoT device, robotics, or any other embedded system, LittleFS can help you manage your files with ease.

## 🚀 Features

- **Fail-Safe Design**: LittleFS is built to ensure data integrity even in the event of unexpected power loss.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead makes it ideal for microcontrollers with limited resources.
- **Simple API**: Easy to use functions that simplify file operations.
- **Configurable**: Tailor the filesystem to meet your specific needs.

## 📦 Installation

To get started with LittleFS, you can download the latest release from our [Releases page](https://github.com/zentadesarrollos/littlefs/releases). Download the appropriate files and follow the instructions to set it up in your project.

## 📜 Usage

### Basic Example

Here’s a simple example of how to use LittleFS in your project:

```c
#include <LittleFS.h>

void setup() {
    LittleFS.begin();
    
    // Create a file
    File file = LittleFS.open("/example.txt", "w");
    if (file) {
        file.println("Hello, LittleFS!");
        file.close();
    }
    
    // Read the file
    file = LittleFS.open("/example.txt", "r");
    if (file) {
        while (file.available()) {
            Serial.write(file.read());
        }
        file.close();
    }
}

void loop() {
    // Your code here
}
```

### API Reference

- `LittleFS.begin()`: Initializes the filesystem.
- `LittleFS.open(path, mode)`: Opens a file for reading or writing.
- `File.read()`: Reads data from the file.
- `File.println(data)`: Writes data to the file.
